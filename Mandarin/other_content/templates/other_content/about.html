        <p>
          Founded in 2021 by a team of young enthusiastic Armenians, Meetq
          educational platform aims to provide compatriots in Armenia and around
          the world with the opportunities to connect and socialize through
          diverse educational programs. Pursuing the goal of having an inclusive
          platform environment, Meetq welcomes everyone of any age or
          knowledge level. It is our hope that the platform will become a venue
          for building a vibrant virtual Armenian community with impactful
          synergy.

        <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Why?</h4>
        <p>
          Education is the driving force for innovation and development.
          Striving for quality and multi-focus programs, our team has come with
          diverse educational backgrounds and shares common concerns over the
          existing educational system/practices in Armenia and beyond. The
          Platform aims to offer programs that are based on engaging and
          interactive teaching methods. We are ready to put all possible efforts
          to build a new, unconventional, open-minded, vibrant and versatile
          educational environment. A core principle we follow is:
          <strong>
            Along with teaching/sharing knowledge, we’d better help the students
            to discover themselves.</strong

        <h4 class="font-weight-bold">How?</h4>
        <p>
          The fees have been optimized to have an inclusive community and to
          address all the members’ interests. And, yet, we understand that there
          will be some, especially in Armenia, that may not be able to afford
          joining our community. For this, we are aiming to build internal
          mechanisms to support others. One such mechanism will be the virtual
          Meetq points to be earned by community members. Those points are
          not a replacement for conventional grades, but become an improved
          version of them. The participants can use their grades earned by
          outstanding activity and achievements to buy gifts for others, take
          part in advanced projects, courses, and give scholarships to those who
          need them. A key principle is that
          <strong>one that wants to join will never be refused.</strong> So, to
          achieve the realization of this, we try to do the best to motivate our
          students to work harder, be creative and proactive.
          <strong>The virtual Meetq points will never be sold.</strong>
